# 100-days-80
Udemy "100 days of Python" challenge. day 80

This repo includes my solution to a section of a Udemy course called "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022" by Dr. Angela Yu.

This challenge is about Seaborn mainly. The challenge is to build a model that predicts a given house's price based on its characteristics; 

+ The number of rooms
+ The distance to employment centres
+ How rich or poor the area is
+ How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

Dataset includes houses in Boston in the 1970s, so it'll not be much of a use. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

In this section I will;
+ Split given data for training and testing
+ Run a Multivariable Regression
+ Evaluate how my model's coefficients and residuals
+ Use data transformation to improve my model performance
+ Use the model to estimate a property price


This section will hopefully teach me about;

+ How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's .pairplot().
+ How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.
+ How to run a multivariable regression.
+ How to evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.
+ How to analyse and look for patterns in a model's residuals.
+ How to improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.
+ How to specify my own values for various features and use my model to make a prediction.
